\details{
 
  Function \code{rarefy} gives the expected species richness in random
  subsamples of size \code{sample} from the community. The size of
  \code{sample} should be smaller than total community size, but the
  function will work for larger \code{sample} as well (with a warning)
  and return non-rarefied species richness (and standard error =
  0). If \code{sample} is a vector, rarefaction of all observations is
  performed for each sample size separately.  Rarefaction can be
  performed only with genuine counts of individuals.  The function
  \code{rarefy} is based on Hurlbert's (1971) formulation, and the
  standard errors on Heck et al. (1975).

  Function \code{rrarefy} generates one randomly rarefied community
  data frame or vector of given \code{sample} size. The \code{sample}
  can be a vector giving the sample sizes for each row.  If the
  \code{sample} size is equal to or smaller than the observed number
  of individuals, the non-rarefied community will be returned.  The
  random rarefaction is made without replacement so that the variance
  of rarefied communities is rather related to rarefaction proportion
  than to the size of the \code{sample}.

  Function \code{drarefy} returns probabilities that species occur in
  a rarefied community of size \code{sample}. The \code{sample} can be
  a vector giving the sample sizes for each row. If the \code{sample}
  is equal to or smaller than the observed number of individuals, all
  observed species will have sampling probability 1.

  Function \code{rarecurve} draws a rarefaction curve for each row of
  the input data. The rarefaction curves are evaluated using the
  interval of \code{step} sample sizes, always including 1 and total
  sample size.  If \code{sample} is specified, a vertical line is
  drawn at \code{sample} with horizontal lines for the rarefied
  species richnesses.

  Function \code{rareslope} calculates the slope of \code{rarecurve}
  (derivative of \code{rarefy}) at given \code{sample} size; the
  \code{sample} need not be an integer.

}

\value{
  A vector of rarefied species richness values. With a single
  \code{sample} and \code{se = TRUE}, function \code{rarefy} returns a
  2-row matrix with rarefied richness (\code{S}) and its standard error
  (\code{se}). If \code{sample} is a vector in \code{rarefy}, the
  function returns a matrix with a column for each \code{sample} size,
  and if \code{se = TRUE}, rarefied richness and its standard error are
  on consecutive lines.

  Function \code{rarecurve} returns \code{\link{invisible}} list of
  \code{rarefy} results corresponding each drawn curve.
