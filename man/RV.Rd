\title{
RV coefficient
}
\description{
Calculates an RV coefficient.
}
\usage{
RV(X, Y)
}

\arguments{
  \item{X}{A matrix with the same number of rows as \code{Y}}
  \item{Y}{A matrix with the same number of rows as \code{X}}
}
\details{
 \code{RV} calculates the RV coefficient between two matrices.The RV 
 coefficient is a multivariate generalization of the squared Pearson's 
 correlation. In package \pkg{FactoMineR}, the function 
 \code{\link[FactoMineR]{coeffRV}} calculates other variations of the 
 RV coefficient and propose a test for it.  This function was designed 
 to calculate only the basic RV coefficient making it much faster than 
 \code{\link[FactoMineR]{coeffRV}}.
}
\value{
The RV coefficient. A numeric value ranging between 0 and 1
