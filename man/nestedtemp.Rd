\title{ Nestedness Indices for Communities of Islands or Patches }

\description{
  Patches or local communities are regarded as nested if they all could
  be subsets of the same community. In general, species poor communities
  should be subsets of species rich communities, and rare species should
  only occur in species rich communities. 
}

nesteddisc(comm, niter = 200)

  \item{kind}{The kind of plot produced.}
  \item{names}{Label columns and rows in the plot using names in \code{comm}.

\details{
  The nestedness functions evaluate alternative indices of nestedness.
  The functions are intended to be used together with Null model
  communities and used as an argument in \code{\link{oecosimu}} to analyse
  the non-randomness of results.
  
  Function \code{nestedchecker} gives the number of checkerboard units,
  or 2x2 submatrices where both species occur once but on different
  sites (Stone & Roberts 1990).

  Function \code{nestedn0} implements
  nestedness measure N0 which is the number of absences from the sites
  which are richer than the most pauperate site species occurs
  (Patterson & Atmar 1986).

  Function \code{nesteddisc} implements discrepancy index which is the
  number of ones that should be shifted to fill a row with ones in a
  table arranged by species frequencies (Brualdi & Sanderson
  1999). The original definition arranges species (columns) by their
  frequencies, but did not have any method of handling tied
  frequencies.  The \code{nesteddisc} function tries to order tied
  columns to minimize the discrepancy statistic but this is rather
  slow, and with a large number of tied columns there is no guarantee
  that the best ordering was found (argument \code{niter} gives the
  maximum number of tried orders). In that case a warning of tied
  columns will be issued.

  Function \code{nestedtemp} finds the matrix temperature which is
  defined as the sum of \dQuote{surprises} in arranged matrix.  In
  arranged unsurprising matrix all species within proportion given by
  matrix fill are in the upper left corner of the matrix, and the
  surprise of the absence or presences is the diagonal distance from the
  fill line (Atmar & Patterson 1993). Function tries to pack species and
  sites to a low temperature (\enc{Rodríguez-Gironés}{Rodriguez-Girones}
  & Santamaria 2006), but this is an iterative procedure, and the
  temperatures usually vary among runs.  Function \code{nestedtemp} also
  has a \code{plot} method which can display either incidences or
  temperatures of the surprises. Matrix temperature was rather vaguely
  described (Atmar & Patterson 1993), but
  \enc{Rodríguez-Gironés}{Rodriguez-Girones} & Santamaria (2006) are
  more explicit and their description is used here. However, the results
  probably differ from other implementations, and users should be
  cautious in interpreting the results. The details of calculations are
  explained in the \code{\link{vignette}} \emph{Design decisions and
  implementation} that you can read using functions
  \code{\link{vignette}} or \code{\link{vegandocs}}. Function
  \code{\link[bipartite]{nestedness}} in the \pkg{bipartite} package is
  a direct port of the BINMATNEST programme of
  \enc{Rodríguez-Gironés}{Rodriguez-Girones} & Santamaria (2006).

  Function \code{nestednodf} implements a nestedness metric based on
  overlap and decreasing fill (Almeida-Neto et al., 2008). Two basic
  properties are required for a matrix to have the maximum degree of
  nestedness according to this metric: (1) complete overlap of 1's
  from right to left columns and from down to up rows, and (2)
  decreasing marginal totals between all pairs of columns and all
  pairs of rows. The nestedness statistic is evaluated separately for
  columns (\code{N columns}) for rows (\code{N rows}) and combined for
  the whole matrix (\code{NODF}).  If you set \code{order = FALSE},
  the statistic is evaluated with the current matrix ordering allowing
  tests of other meaningful hypothesis of matrix structure than
  default ordering by row and column totals (breaking ties by total
  abundances when \code{weighted = TRUE}) (see Almeida-Neto et
  al. 2008). With \code{weighted = TRUE}, the function finds the
  weighted version of the index (Almeida-Neto & Ulrich,
  2011). However, this requires quantitative null models for adequate
  testing. Almeida-Neto & Ulrich (2011) say that you have positive
  nestedness if values in the first row/column are higher than in the
  second.  With this condition, weighted analysis of binary data will
  always give zero nestedness. With argument \code{wbinary = TRUE},
  equality of rows/colums also indicates nestedness, and binary data
  will give identical results in weighted and unweighted analysis.
  However, this can also influence the results of weighted analysis so
  that the results may differ from Almeida-Neto & Ulrich (2011).

  Functions \code{nestedbetasor} and \code{nestedbetajac} find
  multiple-site dissimilarities and decompose these into components of
  turnover and nestedness following Baselga (2010). This can be seen
  as a decomposition of beta diversity (see \code{\link{betadiver}}).
  Function \code{nestedbetasor} uses \enc{Sørensen}{Sorensen}
  dissimilarity and the turnover component is Simpson dissimilarity
  (Baselga 2010), and \code{nestedbetajac} uses analogous methods with
  the Jaccard index. The functions return a vector of three items:
  turnover, nestedness and their sum which is the multiple
  \enc{Sørensen}{Sorensen} or Jaccard dissimilarity. The last one is
  the total beta diversity (Baselga 2010). The functions will treat
  data as presence/absence (binary) and they can be used with binary
  \code{\link{nullmodel}}). The overall dissimilarity is constant in
  all \code{\link{nullmodel}}s that fix species (column) frequencies
  (\code{"c0"}), and all components are constant if row columns are
  also fixed (e.g., model \code{"quasiswap"}), and the functions are
  not meaningful with these null models.

}

\value{
  The result returned by a nestedness function contains an item called
  \code{statistic}, but the other components differ among functions. The
  functions are constructed so that they can be handled by
  \code{\link{oecosimu}}.
