\description{
  Discriminating species between two groups using
  Bray-Curtis dissimilarities
}

\usage{
simper(comm, group, permutations = 0, trace = FALSE, ...)
\method{summary}{simper}(object, ordered = TRUE,
    digits = max(3,getOption("digits") - 3), ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{comm}{Community data matrix.}
  \item{group}{Factor describing the group structure. Must have at
    least 2 levels.}
  \item{permutations}{Number of permutations or a permutation matrix
    where each row gives a permuted index for assessing the
    \dQuote{significance} of the average contribution. Default is set
    to 0 (no permutation test), since computations may take long
    time.}
  \item{trace}{Trace permutations.}
  \item{object}{an object returned by \code{simper}.}
  \item{ordered}{Logical; Should the species be ordered by their
    average contribution?}
  \item{digits}{Number of digits in output.}
  \item{...}{Parameters passed to other functions. In \code{simper} the
    extra parameters are passed to \code{\link[permute]{shuffleSet}} if
    permutations are used.}
}

\details{ Similarity percentage, \code{simper} (Clarke 1993) is based
  on the decomposition of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (see
  \code{\link{vegdist}}, \code{\link{designdist}}). The contribution
  of individual species \eqn{i} to the overall Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
  \eqn{d_{jk}}{d[jk]} is given by

  \deqn{d_{ijk} = \frac{|x_{ij}-x_{ik}|}{\sum_{i=1}^S (x_{ij}+x_{ik})}}{d[ijk] = abs(x[ij]-x[ik])/sum(x[ij]+x[ik])}
  
  where \eqn{x} is the abundance of species \eqn{i} in sampling units
  \eqn{j} and \eqn{k}. The overall index is the sum of the individual
  contributions over all \eqn{S} species 
  \eqn{d_{jk}=\sum_{i=1}^S d_{ijk}}{d[jk] = sum(i=1..S) d[ijk]}. 
  
  The \code{simper} functions performs pairwise comparisons of groups
  of sampling units and finds the average contributions
  of each species to the average overall Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.

  The function displays most important species for each pair of
  \code{groups}.  These species contribute at least to 70 \% of the
  differences between groups.  The function returns much more
  extensive results which can be accessed directly from the result
  object (see section Value). Function \code{summary} transforms the
  result to a list of data frames. With argument \code{ordered = TRUE}
  the data frames also include the cumulative contributions and
  are ordered by species contribution.

\value{
  A list of class \code{"simper"} with following items:
  \item{species}{The species names.}
  \item{average}{Average contribution to overall dissimilarity.}
  \item{overall}{The overall between-group dissimilarity.} 
  \item{sd}{Standard deviation of contribution.} 
  \item{ratio}{Average to sd ratio.}
  \item{ava, avb}{Average abundances per group.}
  \item{ord}{An index vector to order vectors by their contribution or
    order \code{cusum} back to the original data order.}

  \item{p}{Permutation \eqn{p}-value. Probability of getting a larger
    or equal average contribution in random permutation of the group
    factor.}
