\title{ Analysis of Similarities }
\description{
  Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) provides a way to test statistically
  whether there is a significant difference between two or more groups
  of sampling units.
}
\usage{
anosim(dat, grouping, permutations = 999, distance = "bray", strata = NULL,
    parallel = getOption("mc.cores"))
}

\arguments{
  \item{dat}{Data matrix or data frame in which rows are samples and
    columns are response variable(s), or a dissimilarity object or a
    symmetric square matrix of dissimilarities.}
  \item{grouping}{Factor for grouping observations.}
  \item{permutations}{a list of control values for the permutations
    as returned by the function \code{\link[permute]{how}}, or the
    number of permutations required, or a permutation matrix where each
    row gives the permuted indices.}
  \item{distance}{Choice of distance metric that measures the
    dissimilarity between two observations. See \code{\link{vegdist}} for
    options.  This will be used if \code{dat} was not a dissimilarity
    structure or a symmetric square matrix.}  
  \item{strata}{An integer vector or factor specifying the strata for
    permutation. If supplied, observations are permuted only within the
    specified strata.}
  \item{parallel}{Number of parallel processes or a predefined socket
    cluster.  With \code{parallel = 1} uses ordinary, non-parallel
    processing. The parallel processing is done with \pkg{parallel}
    package.}
}
\details{
  Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) provides a way to test statistically
  whether there is a significant difference between two or more groups
  of sampling units.  Function \code{anosim} operates directly on a
  dissimilarity matrix.  A suitable dissimilarity matrix is produced by
  functions \code{\link{dist}} or \code{\link{vegdist}}.  The
  method is philosophically allied with NMDS ordination
  (\code{\link{monoMDS}}), in that it uses only the rank order of
  dissimilarity values.

  If two groups of sampling units are really different in their species
  composition, then compositional dissimilarities between the groups
  ought to be greater than those within the groups.  The \code{anosim}
  statistic \eqn{R} is based on the difference of mean ranks between
  groups (\eqn{r_B}) and within groups (\eqn{r_W}):

  \deqn{R = (r_B - r_W)/(N (N-1) / 4)}

  The divisor is chosen so that \eqn{R} will be in the interval
  \eqn{-1 \dots +1}, value \eqn{0} indicating completely random
  grouping.

  The statistical significance of observed \eqn{R} is assessed by
  permuting the grouping vector to obtain the empirical distribution
  of \eqn{R} under null-model.  See \code{\link{permutations}} for
  additional details on permutation tests in Vegan. The distribution
  of simulated values can be inspected with the \code{\link{permustats}}
  function.

  The function has \code{summary} and \code{plot} methods.  These both
  show valuable information to assess the validity of the method:  The
  function assumes that all ranked dissimilarities within groups 
  have about equal median and range.  The \code{plot} method uses
  \code{\link{boxplot}} with options \code{notch=TRUE} and
  \code{varwidth=TRUE}. 
}
\value{
  The function returns a list of class \code{"anosim"} with following
  items: 
  \item{call }{Function call.}
  \item{statistic}{The value of ANOSIM statistic \eqn{R}}
  \item{signif}{Significance from permutation.}
  \item{perm}{Permutation values of \eqn{R}. The distribution of
    permutation values can be inspected with function \code{\link{permustats}}.}
  \item{class.vec}{Factor with value \code{Between} for dissimilarities
    between classes and class name for corresponding dissimilarity
    within class.}
  \item{dis.rank}{Rank of dissimilarity entry.}
  \item{dissimilarity}{The name of the dissimilarity index: the
    \code{"method"} entry of the \code{dist} object.}
  \item{control}{A list of control values for the permutations
    as returned by the function \code{\link[permute]{how}}.}

\note{

  The \code{anosim} function can confound the differences between groups
  and dispersion within groups and the results can be difficult to
  interpret (cf. Warton et al. 2012).  The function returns a lot of
  information to ease studying its performance. Most \code{anosim}
  models could be analysed with \code{\link{adonis}} which seems to be a
  more robust alternative.
