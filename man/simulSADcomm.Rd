Simulate community matrix with constant SAD
}
\description{
This function simulates community matrices with the same species 
abundance distribution following patterns defined by a set of 
explanatory variables. This function was used to simulate community 
matrices in Blanchet et al. (2014)}
\usage{
simulSADcomm(sp.abund, expl.var, expl.rand.sel = TRUE, nexpl.comb = 2, 
             binary = FALSE, fix.expl = NULL, nsite = 50, weight = NULL, 
             range.weight = c(0, 2), sd.expl = FALSE, norm = c(0, 1))
}
\arguments{
  \item{sp.abund}{
A vector defining the number of species in a bin. See Details for more 
information.
}
  \item{expl.var}{
A matrix of explanatory variables to use to construct the species.
}
  \item{expl.rand.sel}{
Logical. Whether an explanatory variable should be randomly selected to 
construct a species (TRUE) or a fixed combination should be given 
(FALSE). (Default is TRUE)
}
  \item{nexpl.comb}{
Numeric. The number of explanatory variables that will be combined 
together to construct a species. Default is 2.
}
  \item{binary}{
Logical. Whether the site-by-species matrix presents abundances (FALSE) 
or presence/absence (TRUE). Default is FALSE.
}
  \item{fix.expl}{
A matrix that defines which combination of explanatory variables should 
be used to construct species. This argument is only active when 
expl.rand.sel=FALSE. See Details for more information.
}
  \item{nsite}{
Numeric. Number of sites (rows) in the resulting community matrix. See 
Details.
}
  \item{weight}{
A vector of regression coefficient used to give weight to each species. 
If NULL, weights are selected by randomly samping of a uniform 
distribution with a range defined by range.weight. Default is NULL.
}
  \item{range.weight}{
A vector of length 2 giving the minimum and maximum of a uniform 
distribution from which the \code{weight} will be sampled. Default is 
0 and 2.
}
  \item{sd.expl}{
Logical. This argument is only active when \code{expl.rand.sel} is 
FALSE (That is when a fixed combination of explanatory variable is used 
to construct a community matrix). This could be either the standard 
deviation of the Normal error added when constructing a species is a 
multiplier of the standard deviation of the deterministic portion of the
 newly created explanatory variable (TRUE) or the pure standard 
 deviation (FALSE). Default is FALSE.
}
  \item{norm}{
Vector of length 2 giving the mean and a multiplier of the standard 
deviation of the deterministic portion of a newly created explanatory 
variable. Default is mean = 0 and multiplier of the standard deviation 
of the new deterministic explanatory variable = 1.
}
}
\details{
The argument \code{sp.abund} defines the species-abundance distribution 
structure of the data following the binning proposed by Gray et al. 
(2006). For example, if the vector is (40,20,30), it means that there 
will be 40 species with 1 individual, 20 with 2 or 3 individuals, and 
30 with 4 to 7 individuals.

The individuals are assigned to the sites according to the set of 
exlanatory variables given in \code{expl.var}. It is possible that a 
site occur with 0 individuals. They will be included in the community 
matrix and should be dealt with \emph{a posteriori}. 

If \code{expl.rand.sel} is TRUE, the explanatory variables are randomly 
sampled (without replacement) when combining (adding) explanatory 
variables together. The number of explanatory variables must be a 
multiple of nexpl.comb.

Error is included to a species by multiplying a weight to the 
explanatory variable used to construct the species and by adding a 
normally distributed error term to the same explanatory variable. An 
error term with a standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of 
the explanatory variable allows for the explanatory variable to explain 
roughly 50% of the constructed species.

\code{fix.expl} is a matrix that has as many rows as there are species 
and as many columns as \code{nexpl.comb} (number of explanatory 
variables to combine). The numbers in \code{fix.expl} are integers that 
refers to the columns of \code{expl.var}. When \code{fix.expl} is TRUE, 
\code{nexpl.comb} becomes meaningless.

If a presence-absence matrix is constructed (\code{binary}=TRUE), 
\code{sp.abund} should be constructed in such a way that no bin should 
include species with an abundance larger than the number of sites, 
otherwise an error message will be sent. Within, this constraint, if the
maximum of the last bin (the one with the largest abundance) is larger 
than the number of site, it will be automatically changed to the number
of sites-1.

This function was designed to do much more than the simulations 
generated in the work of Blanchet et al. (in press). It is meant to be 
used for future simulation studies.

\value{
\code{site.sp} : The site (rows) by species (column) community matrix 
                 generated.
\code{sel.expl} : A vector presenting the order explanatory variables 
                  used to construct each species. The order follows the 
                  order of the species.
