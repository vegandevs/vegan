}

\arguments{
  \item{x, object}{A \code{cca} result object.}
    \item{choices}{Axes shown.}
  \item{display}{Scores shown.  These must include some of the
    alternatives \code{species} or \code{sp} for species scores,
    \code{sites} or \code{wa} for site scores, \code{lc} for linear
    constraints or ``LC scores'', or \code{bp} for biplot arrows or
    \code{cn} for centroids of factor constraints instead of an arrow.}
  \item{scaling}{Scaling for species and site scores. Either species
    (\code{2}) or site (\code{1}) scores are scaled by eigenvalues, and
    the other set of scores is left unscaled, or with \code{3} both are
    scaled symmetrically by square root of eigenvalues.  Corresponding
    negative values can be used in \code{cca} to additionally multiply
    results with \eqn{\sqrt(1/(1-\lambda))}.  This scaling is know as Hill
    scaling (although it has nothing to do with Hill's rescaling of
    \code{\link{decorana}}). With corresponding negative values
    in\code{rda}, species scores are divided by standard deviation of each
    species and multiplied with an equalizing constant. Unscaled raw
    scores stored in the result can be accessed with \code{scaling = 0}.

    The type of scores can also be specified as one of \code{"none"},
    \code{"sites"}, \code{"species"}, or \code{"symmetric"}, which
    correspond to the values \code{0}, \code{1}, \code{2}, and \code{3}
    respectively. Arguments \code{correlation} and \code{hill} in
    \code{scores.rda} and \code{scores.cca} respectively can be used in
    combination with these character descriptions to get the
    corresponding negative value.
  }
  \item{correlation, hill}{logical; if \code{scaling} is a character
    description of the scaling type, \code{correlation} or \code{hill}
    are used to select the corresponding negative scaling type; either
    correlation-like scores or Hill's scaling for PCA/RDA and CA/CCA
    respectively. See argument \code{scaling} for details.}
  \item{type}{Type of plot: partial match to \code{text}
    for text labels, \code{points} for points, and \code{none} for
    setting frames only.  If omitted, \code{text} is selected for
    smaller data sets, and \code{points} for larger.}
  \item{xlim, ylim}{the x and y limits (min,max) of the plot.}
  \item{labels}{Optional text to be used instead of row names.}
  \item{arrow.mul}{Factor to expand arrows in the graph.  Arrows will be
    scaled automatically to fit the graph if this is missing.}
  \item{head.arrow}{Default length of arrow heads.}
  \item{select}{Items to be displayed.  This can either be a logical
    vector which is \code{TRUE} for displayed items or a vector of indices
    of displayed items.}
  \item{const}{General scaling constant to \code{rda} scores. The
    default is to use a constant that gives biplot scores, that is,
    scores that approximate original data (see \code{\link{vignette}}
    \samp{decision-vegan.pdf} with \code{\link{vegandocs}} for details
    and discussion). If \code{const} is a vector of two items, the first
    is used for species, and the second item for site scores.}
  \item{axis.bp}{Draw \code{\link{axis}} for biplot arrows.}
  \item{axes}{Number of axes in summaries.}
  \item{digits}{Number of digits in output.}
  \item{n, head, tail}{Number of rows printed from the head and tail of
    species and site scores.  Default \code{NA} prints all.}
  \item{...}{Parameters passed to other functions.}
}

\details{
  Same \code{plot} function will be used for \code{\link{cca}} and
  \code{\link{rda}}. This produces a quick, standard plot with current
  \code{scaling}.

  The \code{plot} function sets colours (\code{col}), plotting
  characters (\code{pch}) and character sizes (\code{cex}) to
  certain standard values. For a fuller control of produced plot, it is
  best to call \code{plot} with \code{type="none"} first, and then add
  each plotting item separately using \code{text.cca} or
  \code{points.cca} functions. These use the default settings of standard
  \code{\link{text}} and \code{\link{points}} functions and accept all
  their parameters, allowing  a full user control of produced plots.

  Environmental variables receive a special treatment. With
  \code{display="bp"}, arrows will be drawn. These are labelled with
  \code{text} and unlabelled with \code{points}. The basic \code{plot}
  function uses a simple (but not very clever) heuristics for adjusting
  arrow lengths to plots, but the user can give the expansion factor in
  \code{mul.arrow}. With \code{display="cn"} the centroids of levels of
  \code{\link{factor}} variables are displayed (these are available only if there were
  factors and a formula interface was used in \code{\link{cca}} or
  \code{\link{rda}}). With this option continuous
  variables still are presented as arrows and ordered factors as arrows
  and centroids. 

  If you want to have still a better control of plots, it is better to
  produce them using primitive \code{plot} commands. Function
  \code{scores} helps in extracting the 
  needed components with the selected \code{scaling}.

  Function \code{summary} lists all scores and the output can be very
  long.  You can suppress scores by setting \code{axes = 0} or
  \code{display = NA} or \code{display = NULL}. You can display some
  first or last (or both) rows of scores by using \code{head} or
  \code{tail} or explicit \code{print} command for the \code{summary}.
  
 Palmer (1993) suggested using linear constraints
  (``LC scores'') in ordination diagrams, because these gave better
  results in simulations and site scores (``WA scores'') are a step from
  constrained to unconstrained analysis.  However, McCune (1997) showed
  that noisy environmental variables (and all environmental
  measurements are noisy) destroy ``LC scores'' whereas ``WA scores''
  were little affected.  Therefore the \code{plot} function uses site
  scores (``WA scores'') as the default. This is consistent with the
  usage in statistics and other functions in \R
  (\code{\link[MASS]{lda}}, \code{\link{cancor}}).
}
\value{
  The \code{plot} function returns invisibly a plotting structure which
  can be used by function \code{\link{identify.ordiplot}} to identify
  the points or other functions in the \code{\link{ordiplot}} family. 
}

\note{Package \pkg{ade4} has function \code{\link[ade4]{cca}} which
  returns constrained correspondence analysis of the same class as the
  \pkg{vegan} function. If you have results of \pkg{ade4} in your
  working environment, \pkg{vegan} functions may try to handle them and
  fail with cryptic error messages. However, there is a simple utility
  function \code{ade2vegancca} which tries to translate \pkg{ade4}
  \code{cca} results to \pkg{vegan} \code{cca} results so that some
  \pkg{vegan} functions may work partially with \pkg{ade4} objects
  (with a warning).}
